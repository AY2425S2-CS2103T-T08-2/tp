## Welcome to the KrustyKrab

_For all service staff folks who struggle with keeping track of who's coming to eat._

This is a **CLI-based bookings tracker** which helps in keeping track of booking details and customer information in a simple, efficient, and centralized system for quick and easy management.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

## How does it help?
