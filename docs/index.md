**KrustyKrab is a desktop application for managing customer information and bookings.** While it includes a GUI, most user interactions are performed through a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you're interested in using KrustyKrab, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you're interested in developing KrustyKrab, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a great place to begin.
